Composer - Dependency Management for PHP
========================================

Composer is a dependency manager tracking local dependencies of your projects and libraries.

See [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/) for more information and documentation.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/composer/composer.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/composer/composer)

Installation / Usage
--------------------

1. Download the [`composer.phar`](https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar) executable or use the installer.

    ``` sh
    $ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    ```

2. Create a composer.json defining your dependencies. Note that this example is
a short version for applications that are not meant to be published as packages
themselves. To create libraries/packages please read the
[documentation](http://getcomposer.org/doc/02-libraries.md).

    ``` json
    {
        "require": {
            "monolog/monolog": ">=1.0.0"
        }
    }
    ```

3. Run Composer: `php composer.phar install`
4. Browse for more packages on [Packagist](https://packagist.org).

Installation from Source
------------------------

To run tests, or develop Composer itself, you must use the sources and not the phar
file as described above.

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/composer/composer.git`
2. Download the [`composer.phar`](https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar) executable
3. Run Composer to get the dependencies: `cd composer && php ../composer.phar install`

You can now run Composer by executing the `bin/composer` script: `php /path/to/composer/bin/composer`

Global installation of Composer (manual)
----------------------------------------

Follow instructions [in the documentation](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally)

Updating Composer
-----------------

Running `php composer.phar self-update` or equivalent will update a phar
install with the latest version.
